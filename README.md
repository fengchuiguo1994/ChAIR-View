Visualization for single-cell multi-omic data


ChAIR-Viewer is developped for visualization single-cell multi-omic data. For ensemble data: bedgraph file (coverage signal), bedpe file (loop), bed file (peak/chromhmm/gene annotation) and more. For single cell data: fragment file. ChAIR-Viewer provides a variety of ways to sort cell, including: sorted by RNA UMI count, sorted by ATAC fragment count, sorted by contact/PET count, sorted by maximum contact distance, ordered of hierarchical clustering (in RNA/ATAC/PET data) and more.
